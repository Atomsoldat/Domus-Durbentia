# Domus-Durbentia
A new language.

Background Information:

"Domus Durbentia" Which means "Dark Wisdom" is a made up language consisting of a combination of Sanskrit and Latin. It was made for the 1997 game "Blood" where the enemy Cultist speaks it's insults. No full dictionary was developed, and some words in-game don't have full translations. This project is meant for fans and linguists alike, to add and contribute their ideas for new words, and translations of already-existing ones.
